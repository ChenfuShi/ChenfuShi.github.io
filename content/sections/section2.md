## Current research

In the last decade genetic studies (e.g. GWAS) have linked a large number of variants to complex diseases such as Psoriatic Arthritis. These variants, however, do not usually affect the coding sequence of proteins but rather non-coding regulatory regions often with unknown targets.

In my project I work as a Bioinformatician integrating functional genomics data such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and chromatin conformation to direct the search of target genes that are potentially influenced by disease associated variants.

In my work I have also developed pipelines and software when necessary to process, analyse and integrate the available datasets.  
Recently, I have developed an interest in using Deep Learning techniques to improve the analysis of chromatin conformation maps. These maps have many features that are visible to the human eye but really difficult to describe in the form of a statistical test.  

Some of my work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChenfuShi/)
