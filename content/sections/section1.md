## About Me

My name is Chenfu and I am a PhD student currently studying at the University of Manchester in the 4yr Wellcome Trust PhD programme in Molecular and Cell Biology. I am currently working in Gisela Orozco's lab and I am co-supervised by Magnus Rattray. 

My work involves analysing large scale biological datasets to improve our understanding of complex autoimmune diseases. I focus on developing pipelines and software to process data and I have particular interest in using neural networks in practical applications.

I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Trento (Italy) in Biomolecular Sciences and Technologies. 

In my free time I enjoy building and flying planes and drones (possibly 3d printed).
